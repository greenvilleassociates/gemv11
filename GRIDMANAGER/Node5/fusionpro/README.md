# gsuba-fusion
Greenville Associates Fusion Shell

This shell provides a Open Platform Targeted Windowing System(On Windows/Linux/Unix) to provide javascript, HML5, PHP, Custom Microsoft(.ASPX), and Adobe Cold Fusion binaries to work in an integrated web framework. The Shell also hides the complexity of the software solution from the search bar, making it much friendlier to computer security architects. The shell works with IIS, Apache, and NGINX web servers without modification and links to any database platform supported by your web server. The First release
is targeted for Mysql or Postgres Users using PHP or cPanel(Installatron or Softalicuous Users) but can be used as a standalone web page environment without them.

In General the Gsuba-fusion shell provides a Commerical Desktop Experience to web applications with support for 1080p with a minor modification. The GSuba Shell also installs PHP Driven Web solutions from Joomla, Drupal, and Worpdress out of the box allowing non-developers the ability to complete their marketing tasks on a very sophisticated platform.

We can rebuild corporate Lanscapes at Levels as low as three deep using Image Maps, combined with a Joomla datastore. The default install includes a Header and Footer File which can be customized to meet your business needs. (header.html), and (footer.html).

In the first release we are offering a fixed web platform of 1200px x Unlimited, but the system fixes the bottom bar to a corporate logo offering a much more sophisticated marketing delivery.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR ADDING WORDPRESS LINKS

We recommend installing Wordpress in a "w" directory below the root for the Shell. Create a Mysql database and password and install wordpress from wordpress.org

INSTRUCTIONS FOR ADDING JOOMLA LINKS

We recommend installing Joomla in a "h" directory below the root for the Shell. Create a Mysql database and password and install joomla from joomla.org.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR ADDING FUSIONSHELL TO CPANEL

On Cpanel put the Shell in the root hosting account, and use Softalicious, or Installatron to install applications for the shell. Then just change the links in the header.html file to the location of your code. And Wala you are done.

EXAMPLES CAN BE FOUND ON CAPITOLTECHNOLOGY.US, AND GREENVILLEASSOCIATES.US

If you do this will allow you to maintain consistency with future releases. We have a very complicated example we are building under capitoltechnology.us which uses the same technology fully blown out if you want to see a live example.

It took a few years to make it look nice... so it looks simple but to get cross-browser support looking good is quite difficult in fact.

RELEASE2 is coming... and it will both install wordpress and joomla automatically but will also dynamically adjust the framesize we have set to 1300px's in the Index.html using javascript. Changing that feed to 1040px, or 1200px is easy to do. PLease note almost all new phones, and new PC's will support 1400x1200 resolutions or higher. Older PC's typically dont do too well with HTML in general so we have decided to make a clean break.

RELEASE3 will include an integreate Web Mobility client for Android, and for IoS which should be Q1, 2020.
