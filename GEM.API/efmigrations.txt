/*//EF Migrations should only be used to install the schema on a new machine with the caveat we are adding an installer to the controller with option 99.
//Ef migrations require the project be building without errors.

dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
dotnet ef database update

//Note that after this build, Joomla still needs to be reinstalled with erase parameters.... which will create the files which will be unkown to the controller
//up until the controller attempts to use the system.

//AFTER the database is built delete the EF Migrations table in a DB First model its especially dangerous. and also the EF Migrations Directory which it creates in the project
//as if you synch this you will have problems to the end of time.
