Sample Toolbars with working code provided to modify default framebase configurations. FusionShell and FusionPro create the screen
formatting for every application running inside the shell in framebase.html which is in the root directory. Index.html is design to be a bootstrap to define the size of the
target screen before providing, spacing "rails". By changing jquery.html for other toolbars you can dramatically change the look
of your shell without impacting design of the overall system. gembuttons.html removes the need for jquery and is straight html with javascript.
