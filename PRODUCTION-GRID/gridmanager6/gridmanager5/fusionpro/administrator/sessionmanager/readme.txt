FusionShell is a Container Wrapper and users may be working in sub-tools. For Enterprise Security it might be a requirement not only to have local log files on access(IE W,W2,W3), but also to keep track of session state across the platform.
This would be for a company who builds their own SSO and does not wish to use FSSS0 on joomla (/root/sso....), or wants to use just a basic client-server config.

Furthermore, using Location across the application gets quite complicated, and local browser storage of location data, and session data can be problematic in some cases. We cannot assume, that Administrators in Govt, or High Security locations will 
even write a single file to disk, or even a cookie in the browser. F10 Security Teams literraly trace everything. This directory is a scratch pad for the application to still work, if conditions are extreme locally.
Additionally, a user may allow location once, or sporadically, and not everytime, and thus it may be possible to enhance GPS data by IP address... Users dont usually mess with their ISP connections over long periods of time
as the cable companies tend to recycle IP's and rebooting your device can cause problems. As such most people dont touch their cable modems, and thus have very stable IP addresses in practice. Example Below:

USER X
Access 10/28/2024  72.1.1.13  -34, 128.321
Access 10/29/2024  72.1.1.13   NULL
Access 10/29/2024  33.1.1.1    ALPHA
