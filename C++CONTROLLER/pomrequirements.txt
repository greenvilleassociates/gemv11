Copilot build with activemq
(Installed Properly on Ubuntu22).


Creating a Java service that includes both a sender and a receiver for messages is a fantastic idea! Hereâ€™s a basic example using Java with Java Message Service (JMS) and Apache ActiveMQ as the message broker.

Setting Up Apache ActiveMQ
Download and Start ActiveMQ: Download Apache ActiveMQ here and follow the installation instructions.

<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.activemq</groupId>
        <artifactId>activemq-all</artifactId>
        <version>5.16.3</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>

With this setup, the MessageSender class sends messages to the "TEST_QUEUE" queue, and the MessageReceiver class listens for messages from the same queue. Running the main methods of each class separately will allow you to see the message being sent and received.

Feel free to customize and expand this example to fit your specific needs! If you have any more questions or need further assistance, I'm here to help. ðŸ˜Š2
